## Topic text

Finished works do not materialize out of thin air. Authors, artists, musicians, architects, animators-nearly all creators go through one or more rough drafts before coming up with a finished product. For the drafts below, consider how much the work changes from one iteration to the next, and research the techniques that artists can use to transfer their sketches onto canvases.

Leonardo da Vinci | Mona Lisa (Louvre) & Mona Lisa (Isleworth) (c. 16th century)
Vincent van Gogh | Bedroom in Arles (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1889), & Bedroom in Arles (1889)
Edvard Munch | Despair (1892) & The Scream (1893)
Henri Matisse | Dance (I) (1909) & Dance (II) (1910)

In songwriting, early drafts are called demos. Sometimes, the songwriter will perform them him or herself, even if the song is intended for someone else to sing. Consider the following demos and then the finished product, then ask yourself: what changed along the way? What makes the finished product feel more done?

The Beatles | Strawberry Fields Forever (Home Demo Sequence) (1966)
Lin-Manuel Miranda | This One's Mine (2018)
Sophia Anne Caruso | Dead Mom (Demo) (2019)
EJAE | Golden (various demos) (2025)

In musical theatre, not all demos end up in the final product-but the Internet has allowed these unproduced numbers to find an audience. Consider the following demos that never quite got there. For each, discuss with your team: why do you think it was left out of the finished product?

Aladdin | Count on Me (1994)
Pocahontas | First to Dance (1995)
Book of Mormon | Family Home Evening (2009)
Dear Evan Hansen | In the Bedroom Down the Hall (2017)

Most performers rehearse before they go on stage; some people even rehearse before difficult conversations. Investigate the psychology of rehearsal. What parts of the brain does it affect? How do you know when you have rehearsed enough?

## Learning guidelines

- Compare demo versions with finished songs and identify what changed.
- Discuss why some demos are cut from final productions.
- Investigate the psychology of rehearsal and brain effects.
- Reflect on how to decide when rehearsal is enough.
