## Topic Text

Things to do today include exploring the history of the to-do list (alternate link provided). The topic notes that to-do lists were famously used by Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, then asks scholars to examine modern list approaches and decide which format seems best.

Modern approaches listed:
- Eisenhower Method
- 1-2-3 Method
- Ivy Lee Method
- 4-D Method
- Eat that Frog
- Must-Do
- Bullet Journal

It’s easier to remember unfinished tasks than finished ones. The topic introduces the Zeigarnik Effect and asks how scholars can use it in preparing for the World Scholar’s Cup. It also asks whether keeping a “done list” might be healthier than focusing on unfinished items.

“The list is the origin of culture,” Umberto Eco is quoted as saying. Scholars are asked to learn Eco’s distinction between practical and poetic lists, consider what kind of list a to-do list is, and discuss whether people are more drawn to lists than they should be.

## Learning Guidelines

- Explore the history of the to-do list and compare modern to-do-list formats.
- Discuss with your team which list format seems best and why.
- Use the Zeigarnik Effect to evaluate study and preparation strategies for World Scholar's Cup.
- Discuss whether a “done list” may be healthier than focusing on unfinished tasks.
- Learn Umberto Eco's distinction between practical and poetic lists and apply it to to-do lists.
- Discuss with your team whether people are more drawn to lists than they should be.

## Concepts

- **To-do list** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/02/a-brief-history-of-the-to-do-list-and-the-psychology-of-its-success/252826/, https://web.archive.org/web/20120215211320/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/02/a-brief-history-of-the-to-do-list-and-the-psychology-of-its-success/252826/
  - A to-do list is a task-planning tool used to record and prioritize actions. Historical and modern examples show it as both a practical memory aid and a decision tool. In this topic, it anchors discussion of how list formats affect focus, motivation, and completion.
- **Zeigarnik Effect** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/zeigarnik-effect
  - The Zeigarnik Effect is the tendency for unfinished tasks to remain cognitively active and intrusive. Explanations often emphasize unresolved goals and reduced tension when clear completion plans are made. It is relevant here because list design can either amplify unfinished-task stress or channel it into productive follow-through.
- **Done list** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.oliverburkeman.com/donelist
  - A done list records completed actions rather than pending obligations. It is used to improve reflection, reduce overwhelm from endless backlogs, and reinforce progress signals. In this topic, it provides a counterpoint to conventional to-do lists and to the stress of unfinished tasks.
- **Practical vs poetic lists (Umberto Eco)** (2009)
  - Sources: https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/12/umberto-eco-lists-book-review
  - Eco distinguishes practical lists (finite, functional inventories) from poetic lists (expansive, suggestive, often oriented toward abundance or infinity). The distinction adds a cultural and literary lens to list-making beyond productivity. It is relevant to deciding whether to-do lists should be treated as strict tools or as broader frameworks for meaning and imagination.
- **Eisenhower Method** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/
  - A prioritization method that sorts tasks by urgency and importance, typically into four quadrants (do first, schedule, delegate, and eliminate). It helps users separate reactive work from strategically important work. In this topic, it represents a structured alternative for handling long or stressful to-do lists.
- **1-2-3 Method** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.inloox.com/company/blog/articles/how-to-prioritize-daily-personal-tasks-using-the-1-2-3-method/
  - A daily prioritization format that selects a small fixed set of tasks in descending importance (commonly one top task, then two medium-priority, then three smaller tasks). Variants exist across productivity communities, but the common idea is constrained planning to prevent overload. In this topic, it offers a simple cap-based approach for converting broad intentions into an executable day plan.
- **Ivy Lee Method** (1918)
  - Sources: https://www.theweek.com/articles/647288/daily-routine-help-achieve-peak-productivity
  - A classic method often attributed to Ivy Lee: write six key tasks for the next day, rank them, and work sequentially from highest priority. The method emphasizes focus and strict ordering over multitasking. In this topic, it serves as a historical bridge between early industrial-era productivity advice and modern list discipline.
- **4-D Method** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://uaoa.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-09/Effective%20time%20management%20%28%20In%20workplace%20%26%20Personal%20life%29.pdf
  - A triage-style time-management model that classifies tasks as Do, Defer, Delegate, or Delete. It is designed to reduce clutter by making explicit discard and delegation decisions. In this topic, it exemplifies a filtering approach for list overload when not everything can be completed personally.
- **Eat That Frog** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.briantracy.com/catalog/eat-that-frog
  - A productivity principle associated with Brian Tracy that recommends tackling the most difficult or most important task first. The method aims to reduce procrastination by front-loading cognitively demanding work. In this topic, it contrasts with list systems that prioritize breadth over early deep focus.
- **Must-Do list** (year n/a)
  - Sources: https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/eisenhower-matrix-with-todoist-kj0Eru, https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205873321-Introduction-to-Priorities
  - A must-do list is a narrowed subset of tasks marked as essential for completion today. While implementations vary, the shared principle is identifying non-negotiable priorities before optional work. In this topic, it captures the idea that effective lists must distinguish required outcomes from nice-to-have tasks.
- **Bullet Journal** (2013)
  - Sources: https://help.bulletjournal.com/en-US/articles/about-the-bullet-journal-method-270207, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal
  - Bullet Journal is an analog planning system developed by Ryder Carroll that combines task logging, scheduling, and reflection in a single notebook. It uses short-form bullets, custom collections, and periodic review. In this topic, it represents a flexible, personalized alternative to fixed-format to-do systems.
