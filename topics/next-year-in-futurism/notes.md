## Topic Text

“Science has not yet mastered prophecy,” Neil Armstrong (the first man on the moon) once said. “We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.” Indeed, some technologies exist in a tantalizing but perpetual “almost there”, always just a few years away. Consider the examples below, then discuss with your team: why are these technologies stuck in the near future, and which one would you be most excited to see in action?
fusion power | cure for cancer | graphene | flying cars | virtual reality
nanotechnology | space elevator | food pills | artificial general intelligence
With apologies to Mr. Armstrong, sometimes people also predict too much for the next ten. Consider these predictions for the year 2028, made in 2018. Are there any that haven’t come true yet but that you think still might in the next two years?
“It will soon be possible to transmit wireless messages all over the world so simply that any individual can own and operate his own apparatus,” the inventor Nikola Tesla told the New York Times in 1904. Whether it was an accurate prediction of the smartphone depends on what you think the meaning of “soon” is. For Tesla, soon meant, “I’m building it right now; I just need more funding.” Read more about his Wardenclyffe Tower and the reasons it failed, then discuss with your team: what if it had succeeded?
Tesla is far from the only person to have declared that “it will soon be possible…” Sentences that begin with this and similar phrases (e.g., “In a few years, everyone will…”) almost always make ambitious predictions about the near future. Search online for examples like them, then discuss with your team: for each one, are we there yet, and how long did it take us to get there? If not, how close are we? Here are three examples to get you started.
“…for one man to be heard by every human being on Earth” (1925)
“…to launch a satellite that makes its own solar array in orbit” (2019)
“…for humans to live a thousand years or more” (2025)
Two humans that want to live a thousand years are the presidents of China and Russia. In September 2025, they were overheard talking about using organ transplants to extend their lives indefinitely. As a strategy, organ transplants have major shortcomings: it can be hard to find the organs, and just as hard to stop our immune systems from rejecting them. But people have invested billions of dollars in developing other approaches. Learn more about those listed below, then discuss with your team: if science does find ways for us to live much longer lives, would there be any reason to hesitate before using them?
organoids | bioprinting | plasma transfusion | senotherapeutics
cellular reprogramming | cellular rejuvenation | telomere extension
caloric restriction | digital immortality | cryonics
Read about some of the futuristic technologies predicted in the past, then watch this video that shows how those predictions evolved across the 20th century. Some of them seem fantastical—an Olympics on the moon in the year 2020?—but others may already be within our reach, or just slightly beyond (where they may or may not get stuck). With your team, consider: what can we learn about the past from where people thought we were going? Are any of the things that people predicted about the 21st century things you might now predict for the 22nd?
Who wouldn’t want quantum supremacy? In 2019, Google made a splashy headline: they’d achieved it! Others soon claimed they had too. But researchers admit quantum computers still have no practical purpose, even as cryptographers worry that they could someday be used to hack even the most encrypted passwords. Read more about this much-dreaded Q-Day, then discuss with your team: should we be developing technologies that have unclear practical advantages but clear downsides?
Certainly, here are some examples of text generated by large language models. It's not just the use of em dashes, but the use of negative parallel structures like this. Wikipedia has compiled a list of signs that a piece of text has been generated by AI. We may soon get to a point where we won't be able to accurately distinguish human- and AI-generated content—at least, not without setting deliberate traps. Will it matter?
Deep learning-driven neural networks excel at competing high school English assignments, but it’s not clear that they’re getting anywhere close to artificial general intelligence (AGI)—that is, to an AI that mirrors the ability of humans to learn, understand, and apply knowledge across unlimited contexts. Discuss with your team: should we want to get there? How will our lives change if and when we do?
“Because it’s there,” the British explorer George Mallory once responded, when asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest. (It’s not clear if he ever got there.) During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union looked the opposite direction and launched rival projects to drill as deep as possible into the Earth’s crust. The United States made it about 600 meters; the Soviet Union, about 12,000—resulting in the Kola Superdeep Borehole. The project only shut down in 1992 after the Soviet Union itself went into a hole. Learn more about this project and others like it, then discuss with your team: what, if anything, should be the next frontier humanity tries to reach—and why? And are races—and heated rivalries—the best way to get somewhere quickly?

## Artworks

- None identified in this topic section.

## Concepts

- Fusion power (year: n/a): Electricity generation from controlled nuclear fusion (joining light nuclei). It aims for high energy yield with low long-lived radioactive waste compared with fission. In this topic it represents a long-promised technology often framed as close but not yet widely deployed.
- Cure for cancer (year: n/a): The idea of eliminating cancer across many diseases rather than treating specific cancers case by case. Cancer is a family of conditions with different biology, so progress usually arrives through many therapies rather than one universal cure. It fits the theme of ambitious near-future medical promises.
- Graphene (year: 2004): A single-atom-thick sheet of carbon in a hexagonal lattice. It is extremely strong, conductive, and lightweight, with broad proposed applications from electronics to materials science. In this topic it is an example of a breakthrough material whose mass-market impact has been slower than early hype.
- Flying cars (year: n/a): Roadable aircraft or short-range electric vertical-takeoff air vehicles for urban mobility. Safety, regulation, noise, and infrastructure remain major barriers. The concept is used here as a classic “future that never quite arrives” example.
- Virtual reality (year: n/a): Immersive computer-generated environments experienced through specialized hardware such as headsets and motion input. VR has advanced in gaming, training, and simulation but remains uneven in mainstream daily use. It appears here as an “almost there” technology.
- Nanotechnology (year: n/a): Science and engineering at roughly the 1-100 nanometer scale, where material properties can differ from bulk behavior. It underpins work in medicine, electronics, and materials. In the topic it exemplifies a field with major promise and incremental real-world rollout.
- Space elevator (year: n/a): A proposed tether system from Earth to space enabling payload transport without conventional rockets. The main challenge is finding materials with sufficient strength-to-weight at required lengths. It is included as a frontier idea still far from practical implementation.
- Food pills (year: n/a): A speculative notion that full meals could be replaced by compact nutrient doses. Human eating involves complex nutritional, metabolic, and cultural factors that pills do not fully replicate. It appears as a familiar futuristic simplification that remains largely unrealized.
- Artificial general intelligence (year: n/a): A hypothetical AI with broad, flexible, human-like capability across many domains rather than narrow task performance. Debate continues over timelines, feasibility, and safety implications. It is central to this topic’s question of whether near-future claims are overstated.
- Wardenclyffe Tower (year: 1901): Nikola Tesla’s Long Island project intended for wireless transmission ambitions, including communications and power ideas. Funding and technical constraints prevented completion of Tesla’s broader vision. In this topic it anchors discussion of bold predictions constrained by resources and feasibility.
- Organ transplantation (year: n/a): Surgical replacement of failing organs with donor organs to restore function. Core constraints include donor shortages and immune rejection management. The topic uses transplantation to frame debates over life-extension strategies and ethical tradeoffs.
- Organoids (year: n/a): Miniaturized, lab-grown three-dimensional tissue models derived from stem cells that mimic some organ features. They are used for disease modeling and drug testing, with growing translational relevance. Here they represent potential alternatives to conventional transplant dependence.
- Bioprinting (year: n/a): Additive manufacturing techniques that place cells and biomaterials to build tissue-like structures. Current work ranges from scaffolds to experimental tissue constructs rather than fully functional replacement organs at scale. It appears as a long-horizon regenerative-medicine pathway.
- Plasma transfusion (year: n/a): Transfer of plasma, the liquid component of blood, for therapeutic uses including clotting support and immune-related indications. It has also been discussed in speculative longevity contexts with mixed evidence. The topic includes it as one proposed life-extension approach.
- Senotherapeutics (year: n/a): Interventions targeting cellular senescence, including senolytics (removing senescent cells) and senomorphics/senostatics (modifying harmful signaling). Research aims to reduce age-related decline and disease burden. It fits the theme of frontier longevity science.
- Cellular reprogramming (year: 2006): Resetting mature cells toward pluripotent or altered states by changing gene-expression programs. The induced pluripotent stem cell breakthrough accelerated regenerative research. In this topic it stands for potentially transformative but still-developing anti-aging biotechnology.
- Cellular rejuvenation (year: n/a): A broad research goal of restoring cellular function to a more youthful biological state. Approaches include epigenetic reprogramming and damage-repair pathways, with substantial open safety questions. It aligns with the theme of extending healthy lifespan beyond current limits.
- Telomere extension (year: n/a): Strategies intended to preserve or lengthen telomeres, the chromosome-end structures associated with cellular aging dynamics. Potential benefits are balanced by cancer-risk and regulation concerns. In the topic it is framed as a high-ambition longevity idea.
- Caloric restriction (year: n/a): Sustained reduction of calorie intake without malnutrition, studied for effects on metabolism, lifespan, and healthspan. Results vary by species and human evidence remains mixed on long-term outcomes. It appears as a comparatively low-tech longevity strategy.
- Digital immortality (year: n/a): The speculative idea of preserving a person’s identity or cognition in digital form, often through mind-uploading or persistent AI representations. It remains philosophically and technically unresolved. The topic uses it to contrast biological and computational longevity paths.
- Cryonics (year: n/a): Preservation of legally deceased people at very low temperatures in hopes that future technology could restore them. No current method can revive a cryonically preserved whole human. It exemplifies a radical future-facing response to mortality.
- Quantum supremacy (year: 2019): A threshold claim that a quantum computer can perform a specific computation infeasible for leading classical systems in practical time. Google’s 2019 announcement sparked debate over benchmark choice and practical utility. In this topic it highlights tension between headline breakthroughs and real-world value.
- Q-Day (year: n/a): A term for the point when cryptographically relevant quantum computing could break widely used public-key encryption methods. Security planning emphasizes migration to post-quantum cryptography before that threshold. It is presented here as a downside-risk case in futuristic R&D.
- Signs of AI writing (year: n/a): Heuristics used by reviewers to flag likely machine-generated prose patterns. These cues are imperfect and can create false positives or be gamed by style adaptation. The topic uses this concept to discuss whether human-vs-AI text distinction will remain feasible.
- Kola Superdeep Borehole (year: 1970): A Soviet scientific drilling project on the Kola Peninsula that reached about 12,262 meters depth. It became an emblem of Cold War scientific rivalry and the practical limits of extreme deep-earth drilling. In this topic it supports discussion of frontier races and motivations.
