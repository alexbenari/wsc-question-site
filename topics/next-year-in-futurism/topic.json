  "topic_text": "“Science has not yet mastered prophecy,” Neil Armstrong (the first man on the moon) once said. “We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.” Indeed, some technologies exist in a tantalizing but perpetual “almost there”, always just a few years away. Consider the examples below, then discuss with your team: why are these technologies stuck in the near future, and which one would you be most excited to see in action?\nfusion power | cure for cancer | graphene | flying cars | virtual reality\nnanotechnology | space elevator | food pills | artificial general intelligence\nWith apologies to Mr. Armstrong, sometimes people also predict too much for the next ten. Consider these predictions for the year 2028, made in 2018. Are there any that haven’t come true yet but that you think still might in the next two years?\n“It will soon be possible to transmit wireless messages all over the world so simply that any individual can own and operate his own apparatus,” the inventor Nikola Tesla told the New York Times in 1904. Whether it was an accurate prediction of the smartphone depends on what you think the meaning of “soon” is. For Tesla, soon meant, “I’m building it right now; I just need more funding.” Read more about his Wardenclyffe Tower and the reasons it failed, then discuss with your team: what if it had succeeded?\nTesla is far from the only person to have declared that “it will soon be possible…” Sentences that begin with this and similar phrases (e.g., “In a few years, everyone will…”) almost always make ambitious predictions about the near future. Search online for examples like them, then discuss with your team: for each one, are we there yet, and how long did it take us to get there? If not, how close are we? Here are three examples to get you started.\n“…for one man to be heard by every human being on Earth” (1925)\n“…to launch a satellite that makes its own solar array in orbit” (2019)\n“…for humans to live a thousand years or more” (2025)\nTwo humans that want to live a thousand years are the presidents of China and Russia. In September 2025, they were overheard talking about using organ transplants to extend their lives indefinitely. As a strategy, organ transplants have major shortcomings: it can be hard to find the organs, and just as hard to stop our immune systems from rejecting them. But people have invested billions of dollars in developing other approaches. Learn more about those listed below, then discuss with your team: if science does find ways for us to live much longer lives, would there be any reason to hesitate before using them?\norganoids | bioprinting | plasma transfusion | senotherapeutics\ncellular reprogramming | cellular rejuvenation | telomere extension\ncaloric restriction | digital immortality | cryonics\nRead about some of the futuristic technologies predicted in the past, then watch this video that shows how those predictions evolved across the 20th century. Some of them seem fantastical—an Olympics on the moon in the year 2020?—but others may already be within our reach, or just slightly beyond (where they may or may not get stuck). With your team, consider: what can we learn about the past from where people thought we were going? Are any of the things that people predicted about the 21st century things you might now predict for the 22nd?\nWho wouldn’t want quantum supremacy? In 2019, Google made a splashy headline: they’d achieved it! Others soon claimed they had too. But researchers admit quantum computers still have no practical purpose, even as cryptographers worry that they could someday be used to hack even the most encrypted passwords. Read more about this much-dreaded Q-Day, then discuss with your team: should we be developing technologies that have unclear practical advantages but clear downsides?\nCertainly, here are some examples of text generated by large language models. It's not just the use of em dashes, but the use of negative parallel structures like this. Wikipedia has compiled a list of signs that a piece of text has been generated by AI. We may soon get to a point where we won't be able to accurately distinguish human- and AI-generated content—at least, not without setting deliberate traps. Will it matter?\nDeep learning-driven neural networks excel at competing high school English assignments, but it’s not clear that they’re getting anywhere close to artificial general intelligence (AGI)—that is, to an AI that mirrors the ability of humans to learn, understand, and apply knowledge across unlimited contexts. Discuss with your team: should we want to get there? How will our lives change if and when we do?\n“Because it’s there,” the British explorer George Mallory once responded, when asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest. (It’s not clear if he ever got there.) During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union looked the opposite direction and launched rival projects to drill as deep as possible into the Earth’s crust. The United States made it about 600 meters; the Soviet Union, about 12,000—resulting in the Kola Superdeep Borehole. The project only shut down in 1992 after the Soviet Union itself went into a hole. Learn more about this project and others like it, then discuss with your team: what, if anything, should be the next frontier humanity tries to reach—and why? And are races—and heated rivalries—the best way to get somewhere quickly?",
