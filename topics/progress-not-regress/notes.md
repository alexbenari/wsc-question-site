## Topic text

- Before 1985, you’d have had no idea how long it would take to install a program on your computer—or to save a file, or to complete an online form. (To be fair, there were no online forms.) Consider the history of the progress bar, then discuss with your team: what other activities and interactions in life would benefit from a progress bar?
- Bars are not the only way to pass time. Explore the following alternatives to the standard progress bar, then discuss with your team: what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
- indeterminate progress bar | splash screen | console output | skeleton screen | throbber
- Some progress bars continue to inch along even when a process is actually stuck; the idea is to encourage people not to give up. Explore the idea of placebo buttons—such as the “close door” buttons on elevators that almost never close the doors, or pedestrian crossing buttons that don’t have any impact on traffic lights—then discuss with your team: when, if ever, is it okay to mislead people so that they feel better about a process?
- Some schemes can be quite elaborate. For instance, one airport discovered that, if planes parked further away so that people had to walk longer to baggage claim, they complained less about waiting for their bags once they got there. They were happier moving along than idling at the carousel, even if the total wait time was the same. Can you think of other situations in which people could be tricked into feeling less impatient?
- Designers have discovered that progress bars in apps make users more likely to complete tasks such as surveys and applications. Discuss with your team: is it okay to design interfaces that persuade people to complete actions? Is there a point past which nudging becomes manipulation?
- In 1994, the developers of Namco’s Ridge Racer added an Easter egg to their loading screens—a version of the studio’s classic Galaxian game. Google Chrome does something similar: its Dinosaur Game appears when your device goes offline temporarily. In the real world, some restaurants now encourage diners to play games on table-mounted payment terminals (for a fee) while waiting for their food. Discuss with your team: should more processes come with these kinds of “auxiliary games” to help people pass the time?
- You can’t know if you’re there yet without some way to measure progress; the same is true for entire societies. Learn about the following socioeconomic indicators with your team: what do they try to measure? Then look up the numbers corresponding to your country and discuss with your team: how accurately do they reflect what it’s like to live there? And how should we decide what the end—or goal—of a society is?
- Gross Domestic Product | Gross National Income | Gini Coefficient
- Human Development Index | Multidimensional Poverty Index | Labor Productivity
- Happiness Index | Passport Index | Big Mac Index
- The Second Law of Thermodynamics suggests that closed systems always grow more disordered over time. Left to themselves, things get messier: your room won’t clean itself. Yet many people take for granted that the world as a whole should become better over time. “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” said Martin Luther King, Jr., a quote that may have preceded and certainly outlived him. But it turns out that this idea that the world improves over time may be a relatively new one (alternate link). Discuss with your team: is the world growing better? Be sure to check out the artist Will Crawford’s answer to this question in this 1909 painting. What would a painting with the same title look like today?

## Learning guidelines

- Consider the history of the progress bar, then discuss with your team what other activities and interactions in life would benefit from a progress bar.
- Explore alternatives to the standard progress bar and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
