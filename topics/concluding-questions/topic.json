  "topic_text": "1. When is it a good idea to give up? Be sure to learn about the sunk cost fallacy. Does it imply that we should quit on things more often? How about on people?\n\n2. Is it always better to know how long it will take you to get somewhere? If not, what are examples of times when it would be better not to know?\n\n3. What if it takes us forever to get there? Consider the \"dichotomy paradox\" posed by the Greek philosopher Zeno. He observed that to walk across a thing, for instance Greenland (which belongs to Denmark), first you need to walk across half of it. Then you need to walk across half of what is left, then half of what is left after that, and so forth. Since there is always another half to go, you will never reach the other end. How would you solve this and his other paradoxes of motion?\n\n4. \"Are we there yet?\" is a question linked with impatience. Explore the psychology of patience: what makes some people willing to calmly wait a little longer? Is patience more valued in some cultures than in others? And does patience have downsides?\n\n5. World War I was \"the War to End All Wars\"; 1989 was, per Francis Fukuyama, \"The End of History\". The first meant achieving global peace; the second trumpeted the triumph of liberal democracy. The world is not there yet, in either case, but is it getting closer? Should one or both of these be our goals in the first place?\n\n6. I choose to believe. Endings are not always clear. In the final episode of Stargate Universe, a starship flies off into the vast emptiness between galaxies, its fate never to be resolved; cancellation left its crew's future ambiguous. Other works of fiction have ended with more deliberate uncertainty. The Sopranos infamously cut to black; the last chapter of Life of Pi lets us decide whether the main character really made friends with a tiger; Deckard may or may not be a replicant. How important is it that stories end definitively? Can you think of any that should have ended a little earlier or skipped their epilogues?\n\n7. This ending is clear: we are there. Where do we go next?",

      "description": "A science-fiction television series about a stranded crew aboard the ancient ship Destiny in deep space. Created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, it aired from 2009 to 2011 and ended without full narrative closure after cancellation. In this topic, it functions as an example of unresolved endings and whether ambiguity can still feel meaningful."

      "description": "An American television drama centered on mob boss Tony Soprano and his family and criminal life. Created by David Chase, the series ran from 1999 to 2007 and is well known for its abrupt final cut to black. The work is used here to test whether viewers need explicit closure at a story's end."

Economically, sunk costs should not drive forward-looking decisions, but people often let them do so. In this topic, it directly informs when giving up may be rational rather than a failure."

The dichotomy paradox claims one must complete infinitely many halves to reach a destination. In this topic, it sharpens the theme of progress, delay, and whether reaching goals is conceptually straightforward."

Expanded from a 1989 essay into a 1992 book, the thesis concerns ideological destination rather than the end of conflict itself. In this topic, it frames debate over whether humanity has collective end states and whether those ends are desirable."
