## Topic Text
Dubai barely has sidewalks; in New York they are busy with pedestrians and street vendors. The topic asks teams to examine sidewalks as a liminal space between street and building, and compare how sidewalk history and design vary across places.

It then moves to moving sidewalks, airport walkways, and the history of parking in the United States, including whether free parking should be treated as a right.

The section highlights parking lots as architecture, with examples including Temple Street Parking Garage, Lego Parking House, Parc des Celestins, Michigan Theater, Garagenatelier Car Park, and 9th Avenue Parkade.

It also raises suburban "snout houses," Frank Lloyd Wright's car-oriented residential ideas, and Robie House. The topic closes by looking at Los Angeles downtown lots converted into Grand Park as a model of turning car space into public gathering space.

## Learning Guidelines
- Research the history of sidewalks, including where they first emerged and when modern sidewalks were built.
- Learn more about historical efforts to popularize moving sidewalks.
- Investigate the history of parking and debate whether free parking should be a right.
- Read about Temple Street Parking Garage and compare it with other architecturally notable parking lots.
- Consider examples of snout houses and discuss whether garages should be more hidden.
- Explore Frank Lloyd Wright's automotive architecture and the design history of Robie House.
- Observe how Los Angeles converted parking lots into Grand Park and discuss comparable opportunities in your city.
