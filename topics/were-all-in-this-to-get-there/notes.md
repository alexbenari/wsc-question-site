## Topic text
- As returning scholars might remember, some big projects take much too long to finish—high speed rail in California, the Haunted Chocolatier, these outlines. Some never get there at all. Explore the following examples of projects that weren’t finished on time, then discuss with your team: What factors, if any, did these delays have in common? How would you have overcome them? And are there projects out there in the world today that you predict will suffer a similar fate?
- La Sagrada Familia | Spain
- Nusantara Capital City | Indonesia
- Ryugyong Hotel | North Korea
- Wonderland Amusement Park | China
- Berlin Brandenburg Airport | Germany
- Milan Cathedral | Italy
- Crazy Horse Memorial | South Dakota
- The science of project management aims to prevent delays and failures like those above. And, while it’s only been formally studied in recent centuries, project management itself isn’t a new concept. The makers of the Egyptian pyramids had to deploy a large workforce. China built a notable wall. The Romans devised their roads. Medieval cathedrals reached breathtaking heights. All of these things were complex operations that had to be managed somehow. Consider the history of project management , then discuss with your team: are such megaprojects harder to build now than in the past?
- The makers of the pyramids might have benefitted from a Gantt chart —an approach invented in the early 20th century which shows a project schedule in the form of a bar chart. Some bars represent tasks that can be worked on at the same time; others need earlier bars to be completed before you can start on them. Explore how Gantt Charts helped in the construction of the Hoover Dam in the United States and how they even became popular in the early Soviet Union, then discuss with your team: what is gained when you translate a project into this kind of format—and what is lost?
- Sleep, study, and a social life: choose two, because you can’t have all three. At least, that’s what an old student proverb would have us believe. There is a similar “Iron Triangle” in project management: scope, time, and cost. You can do something faster, but it’ll cost more or be smaller in scale. You can do something bigger, but it’ll take more time or cost more. You can do something more cheaply, but it’ll end up slower or smaller. Explore the tools below for navigating these pressures, then discuss with your team: are there times when we might want something to be smaller, slower, or more expensive?
- Kanban | Gantt Charts | Harmonogram | Dependencies | Risk Register
- Stakhanovite Movement | Critical Path Method | Program Evaluation and Review Technique
- YouTube began as a dating website; Netflix used to mail people movie rentals on DVDs; Amazon started out selling books and now leads the world in cloud computing. Even the project management software juggernaut Slack began as a chat feature inside a video game. Where many large companies in the 20th century planned every step of their projects in advance, today expectations have shifted away from perfectly sequenced plans to faster pivots between products and even business models. Explore this shift, then discuss with your team: is it better to have a rigid map that might be wrong or no map at all and a very fast pair of shoes?
- Waterfall method | Command-Control | Toyota Production System | Chaos Engineering
- Agile Manifesto | Six Sigma | Sashimi Model | The Three Ways
- “The Phoenix Project” Philosophy
- Even before Gantt charts and the waterfall method, there was Frederick Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management . Taylor thought of workers as gears in a machine; he used stopwatches to measure the “one best way” to get to the end of a task. Explore the related concepts below, then discuss with your team: in our age of algorithmic management and remote work monitoring , have we returned to the “stopwatch” era? How would you want to be managed?
- Taylorism and the Four Principles | Max Weber’s Bureaucracy | Ford Assembly Line
- Total Quality Management (TQM)
- Managers need people to manage—but those people can be frustratingly slow and easily distracted. Explore the psychological and structural “laws” that supposedly govern human effort, then discuss with your team: how do they apply to your preparations for this competition?
- The Hawthorne Effect | Hofstadter’s Law | the 90-90 Rule | Conway’s Law
- Putt’s Law | Illich’s Law | Laborit’s Law | Brooks’ Law
- Maybe studying just 20% of this curriculum will get you a high enough score. The pareto principle suggests that, in any given process, 80% of outcomes come from 20% of inputs. In a project, it implies 20% of the effort can lead to 80% of the results. Discuss with your team: are most people overworking most of the time?

## Learning guidelines
- Explore the examples of delayed or unfinished projects and discuss which factors they have in common, how you would have addressed them, and which current projects may face similar outcomes.
- Consider the history of project management and discuss whether modern megaprojects are harder to complete than earlier ones.
- Explore how Gantt charts were used (including Hoover Dam and early Soviet usage) and discuss what this format gains and loses.
- Explore tools related to the project-management Iron Triangle (scope, time, cost) and discuss when smaller, slower, or more expensive outcomes may be desirable.
- Explore the shift from rigid long-range planning to faster pivots in products and business models, and discuss whether a rigid map or rapid adaptability is better.
- Explore concepts related to scientific management and discuss whether algorithmic management and remote work monitoring recreate a modern 'stopwatch' era.
- Explore psychological and structural 'laws' about human effort and discuss how they apply to your preparation for this competition.
- Discuss whether the Pareto principle suggests that most people overwork relative to the outcomes they achieve.

## Artworks
- La Sagrada Familia (1882) - Antoni Gaudi
  - A monumental Roman Catholic basilica in Barcelona with organic stone facades, tall spires, and colored-light interiors. Begun in 1882 and transformed by Antoni Gaudi from 1883, it became one of the most famous unfinished works in architecture; completion has stretched across wars, funding shifts, and technical changes. It fits this topic as a long-duration project where visionary scope and real-world constraints collide.
- Nusantara Capital City (2022) - Government of Indonesia and Nusantara Capital City Authority
  - A planned new Indonesian capital under construction in East Kalimantan, designed as a large-scale administrative and urban development project. Construction began in 2022 with phased targets extending years into the future and changing political priorities shaping momentum. It is relevant as a contemporary mega-project exposed to transitions in leadership, budget, and public narrative.
- Ryugyong Hotel (1987) - Baikdoosan Architects & Engineers
  - A 330-meter pyramidal high-rise in Pyongyang that became an emblem of stalled construction after work halted in the 1990s and resumed only partially later. Planned as a prestige hotel, it remained largely unopened despite its completed exterior form. It illustrates how geopolitical and economic shocks can interrupt project delivery for decades.
- Wonderland Amusement Park (Beijing) (1998) - Reignwood Group
  - An unfinished theme-park development outside Beijing that halted early and never opened as intended. The abandoned castle-like frame became a symbol of failed ambition before later demolition and land reuse. It is relevant as a case where financing and development alignment failed before project completion.
- Berlin Brandenburg Airport (2006) - Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH
  - Germany's new Berlin airport project, marked by long delays and costly technical and governance setbacks before opening in 2020. The project became a widely cited case in modern infrastructure management failures. It connects directly to this topic's focus on why complex projects miss timelines.
- Milan Cathedral (1386) - Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano
  - The Duomo di Milano is a Gothic cathedral whose construction began in 1386 and continued over centuries. Its marble facades, dense spire field, and long phased build history make it an archetype of slow, multigenerational construction. It supports the topic's question of whether long timelines are exceptional or structural in monumental projects.
- Crazy Horse Memorial (1948) - Korczak Ziolkowski and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation
  - A mountain carving in South Dakota depicting Lakota leader Crazy Horse, begun in 1948 and still in progress. Initiated by sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and continued by a family-run foundation, it combines monumental artistic intent with very long execution cycles. It is relevant as a living example of scope, symbolism, and completion tension.

## Concepts
- History of project management (n/a)
  - A broad account of how planning, coordination, and control practices evolved from ancient construction to modern management methods. It provides context for why today's tools exist and where their assumptions came from. In this topic it frames delays as recurring historical problems rather than purely modern failures.
- Gantt chart (1910s)
  - A bar-chart scheduling method showing tasks over time, often with dependencies and milestones. It became a standard planning and tracking tool in construction and software projects. It is central here because visual planning can both clarify delivery paths and hide uncertainty.
- Iron Triangle (scope-time-cost) (n/a)
  - A project-management tradeoff model where scope, time, and cost constrain one another. Changing one dimension tends to force movement in at least one of the others. It is relevant because many delays in the topic examples can be read as unresolved triangle tradeoffs.
- Kanban (1940s)
  - A visual workflow method using pull-based task movement and work-in-progress limits. Originating in manufacturing and later adapted to software, it emphasizes flow and bottleneck visibility. It relates to the topic by offering an alternative to rigid long-range scheduling.
- Harmonogram (1890s)
  - An early schedule-chart precursor associated with Karol Adamiecki's timeline visualization ideas. It represents one of the early attempts to make work sequencing visible before modern PM software. In this topic it highlights that timeline visualization predates contemporary methods.
- Task dependencies (n/a)
  - Logical relationships where one task depends on completion of another. Dependencies determine feasible sequencing and expose potential schedule blockers. They are relevant because hidden dependency chains are a major source of overruns.
- Risk register (n/a)
  - A structured list of project risks, impacts, probabilities, owners, and mitigation plans. It is used to make uncertainty explicit and manageable over time. It matters here because many delayed projects are effectively unmanaged risk accumulations.
- Stakhanovite movement (1935)
  - A Soviet labor campaign promoting exceptional output norms, named after miner Alexey Stakhanov. It tied productivity targets to ideology and public performance. In this topic it raises questions about whether output pressure improves or distorts real project delivery.
- Critical Path Method (CPM) (1950s)
  - A scheduling method that identifies the longest chain of dependent tasks determining minimum project duration. It helps managers focus on tasks where delay directly delays the whole project. It is relevant as a classic tool for controlling complex timelines.
- Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) (1958)
  - A network-based planning method using time estimates to model uncertainty in activity durations. Developed for large defense projects, it supports probabilistic schedule thinking. It fits this topic because it formalizes planning under uncertainty rather than assuming exact durations.
- Waterfall method (1970)
  - A sequential development model with distinct phases and limited backtracking. It can provide clarity and traceability but is less adaptable when requirements shift. This topic uses it to contrast rigid planning with adaptive pivots.
- Command and control management (n/a)
  - A centralized decision style where direction and authority flow top-down. It can improve short-term coordination under clear objectives but may reduce local adaptability. It is relevant when comparing strict control with flexible project models.
- Toyota Production System (1950s)
  - A manufacturing philosophy centered on waste reduction, flow, quality at source, and continuous improvement. It heavily influenced lean management and later software/operations practices. It matters here as a model for balancing speed, quality, and reliability.
- Chaos engineering (2010s)
  - A resilience practice of deliberately testing systems with controlled failures in production-like environments. It aims to surface weak points before real incidents occur. It is relevant because modern project outcomes depend on robustness, not only delivery dates.
- Agile Manifesto (2001)
  - A values statement for iterative, adaptive software development emphasizing individuals, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. It underpins many modern delivery methods. In this topic it represents the shift away from fully preplanned project maps.
- Six Sigma (1980s)
  - A data-driven quality methodology aimed at reducing defects and process variation. Popularized in industry and services, it links measurement with process control. It relates to the topic through tradeoffs between optimization rigor and delivery speed.
- Sashimi model (1980s)
  - A development variation where phases overlap rather than follow strict serial completion. It keeps some staged structure while allowing earlier feedback than classic waterfall. It is relevant as a middle ground between rigid and fully agile approaches.
- The Three Ways (2013)
  - A DevOps framing from The Phoenix Project emphasizing flow, feedback, and continual learning. It links technical delivery practices with organizational behavior. It is relevant because project outcomes depend on system-wide learning loops, not only plans.
- The Phoenix Project philosophy (2013)
  - A management and DevOps narrative framework focused on bottlenecks, flow efficiency, and cross-functional collaboration. It translates operations constraints into organizational change practices. In this topic it supports discussion of how organizations recover failing delivery systems.
- Principles of Scientific Management (1911)
  - Frederick W. Taylor's foundational text on measurement-driven labor optimization and standardized methods. It shaped industrial management and later debates about worker autonomy. It is relevant to the prompt's question about modern monitoring and control.
- Remote work monitoring (2022)
  - Digital oversight practices used to track remote employee activity, output, or compliance. The CIPD discussion frames legal, ethical, and trust implications of such monitoring. It is relevant as a modern parallel to older stopwatch-style management logic.
- Taylorism (1910s)
  - An approach to labor organization based on standardization, timing, and managerial control of work methods. It sought efficiency gains through systematic analysis of tasks. It matters here because several listed methods react to or evolve from Taylorist assumptions.
- Max Weber's bureaucracy (early 1900s)
  - A model of formal organization based on hierarchy, rules, specialization, and impersonal procedures. It explains how large institutions coordinate complex work at scale. In this topic it helps explain why process-heavy systems can be both reliable and slow.
- Ford assembly line (1913)
  - A moving-line production method that greatly increased output through standardized tasks and sequencing. It became a landmark in industrial throughput optimization. It is relevant as a precursor to modern debates on efficiency versus flexibility.
- Total Quality Management (TQM) (1950s)
  - An organization-wide quality approach focused on continuous improvement, customer needs, and process discipline. It diffused across manufacturing and services as a management philosophy. It relates to the topic through quality-time-cost balance in long projects.
- Hawthorne effect (1920s)
  - The observed tendency for behavior to change when people know they are being studied. The term is commonly invoked in workplace productivity discussions. It is relevant to management experiments and monitoring regimes discussed in this topic.
- Hofstadter's law (1979)
  - An adage that tasks take longer than expected, even after accounting for that tendency. It captures persistent underestimation in complex work. It directly matches this topic's focus on schedule optimism and slippage.
- Ninety-ninety rule (1985)
  - A software aphorism: the first 90% of the work takes 90% of the time, and the last 10% takes another 90%. It highlights hidden integration and finishing costs. It is relevant as a concise explanation for chronic late-stage project delays.
- Conway's law (1967)
  - The idea that system designs mirror the communication structures of organizations that build them. It links organizational form to technical architecture outcomes. It is relevant because delivery problems often reflect coordination structure, not only technical complexity.
- Putt's Law (1981)
  - A management aphorism about a mismatch between technical understanding and managerial authority in organizations. It is often used to criticize competence inversions in technical hierarchies. It relates to the topic through governance failures in complex projects.
- Illich's Law (n/a)
  - A popular productivity aphorism claiming that after a point, extra work time yields worse results. The term is used in modern productivity writing, though formal canonical sourcing is less standardized than classic PM laws. It is relevant to discussions of overwork versus effective progress.
- Laborit's Law (n/a)
  - A popular behavioral claim that people gravitate toward immediately rewarding tasks and postpone uncomfortable ones. It is frequently used in productivity coaching contexts to explain procrastination patterns. It is relevant because task-avoidance behavior can distort project sequencing and timelines.
- Brooks's Law (1975)
  - A software-project principle stating that adding people to a late project can make it later. The main mechanisms are onboarding time and increased communication overhead. It is directly relevant to the topic's question of why rescue efforts can worsen schedule slippage.
- Pareto principle (80/20 rule) (1906)
  - A heuristic that a minority of inputs often produces a majority of outcomes. In project contexts it supports prioritizing high-impact tasks over exhaustive effort. It is relevant to the topic's closing prompt on overwork and efficiency.
