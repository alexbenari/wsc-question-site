  "topic_text": "- As returning scholars might remember, some big projects take much too long to finish—high speed rail in California, the Haunted Chocolatier, these outlines. Some never get there at all. Explore the following examples of projects that weren’t finished on time, then discuss with your team: What factors, if any, did these delays have in common? How would you have overcome them? And are there projects out there in the world today that you predict will suffer a similar fate?\n- La Sagrada Familia | Spain\n- Nusantara Capital City | Indonesia\n- Ryugyong Hotel | North Korea\n- Wonderland Amusement Park | China\n- Berlin Brandenburg Airport | Germany\n- Milan Cathedral | Italy\n- Crazy Horse Memorial | South Dakota\n- The science of project management aims to prevent delays and failures like those above. And, while it’s only been formally studied in recent centuries, project management itself isn’t a new concept. The makers of the Egyptian pyramids had to deploy a large workforce. China built a notable wall. The Romans devised their roads. Medieval cathedrals reached breathtaking heights. All of these things were complex operations that had to be managed somehow. Consider the history of project management , then discuss with your team: are such megaprojects harder to build now than in the past?\n- The makers of the pyramids might have benefitted from a Gantt chart —an approach invented in the early 20th century which shows a project schedule in the form of a bar chart. Some bars represent tasks that can be worked on at the same time; others need earlier bars to be completed before you can start on them. Explore how Gantt Charts helped in the construction of the Hoover Dam in the United States and how they even became popular in the early Soviet Union, then discuss with your team: what is gained when you translate a project into this kind of format—and what is lost?\n- Sleep, study, and a social life: choose two, because you can’t have all three. At least, that’s what an old student proverb would have us believe. There is a similar “Iron Triangle” in project management: scope, time, and cost. You can do something faster, but it’ll cost more or be smaller in scale. You can do something bigger, but it’ll take more time or cost more. You can do something more cheaply, but it’ll end up slower or smaller. Explore the tools below for navigating these pressures, then discuss with your team: are there times when we might want something to be smaller, slower, or more expensive?\n- Kanban | Gantt Charts | Harmonogram | Dependencies | Risk Register\n- Stakhanovite Movement | Critical Path Method | Program Evaluation and Review Technique\n- YouTube began as a dating website; Netflix used to mail people movie rentals on DVDs; Amazon started out selling books and now leads the world in cloud computing. Even the project management software juggernaut Slack began as a chat feature inside a video game. Where many large companies in the 20th century planned every step of their projects in advance, today expectations have shifted away from perfectly sequenced plans to faster pivots between products and even business models. Explore this shift, then discuss with your team: is it better to have a rigid map that might be wrong or no map at all and a very fast pair of shoes?\n- Waterfall method | Command-Control | Toyota Production System | Chaos Engineering\n- Agile Manifesto | Six Sigma | Sashimi Model | The Three Ways\n- “The Phoenix Project” Philosophy\n- Even before Gantt charts and the waterfall method, there was Frederick Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management . Taylor thought of workers as gears in a machine; he used stopwatches to measure the “one best way” to get to the end of a task. Explore the related concepts below, then discuss with your team: in our age of algorithmic management and remote work monitoring , have we returned to the “stopwatch” era? How would you want to be managed?\n- Taylorism and the Four Principles | Max Weber’s Bureaucracy | Ford Assembly Line\n- Total Quality Management (TQM)\n- Managers need people to manage—but those people can be frustratingly slow and easily distracted. Explore the psychological and structural “laws” that supposedly govern human effort, then discuss with your team: how do they apply to your preparations for this competition?\n- The Hawthorne Effect | Hofstadter’s Law | the 90-90 Rule | Conway’s Law\n- Putt’s Law | Illich’s Law | Laborit’s Law | Brooks’ Law\n- Maybe studying just 20% of this curriculum will get you a high enough score. The pareto principle suggests that, in any given process, 80% of outcomes come from 20% of inputs. In a project, it implies 20% of the effort can lead to 80% of the results. Discuss with your team: are most people overworking most of the time?",
