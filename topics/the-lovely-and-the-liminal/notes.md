## Topic text

You are there now, but why? The section introduces the doorway effect: temporary memory loss after crossing a threshold, and frames liminality as being in-between where you were and where you are going. It asks students to think about examples of liminal spaces and thresholds in daily life.

It then turns to found-footage and game media, including The Backrooms (2022), POOLS, and The Stanley Parable (2013), asking why liminal settings can feel uneasy and effective.

The section references Immanuel Kant's idea that beauty can feel purposive even without practical purpose, and asks whether that helps explain attraction to liminal spaces.

It presents works set in shared transitional spaces (stations, trains, airports, elevators): Rain, Steam, and Speed (1844), The Railway Station (1862), Picture of the Railroad at Takanawa (1871), Gare Saint-Lazare (1877), "Drip, Drip, Drip" (c. 1924), Train Station, Agra, 1983 (1983), and Six in Four (2015).

It explores waiting rooms and non-places through architecture and design, including how waiting-room design can decrease or amplify anxiety.

It notes that popular use of the word liminal has expanded and offers works for debate: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1897-98), The Treachery of Images (1929), The Persistence of Memory (1931), Christina's World (1948), Ascending and Descending (1960), Beneath the Roses (2004), and The Distant is Imminent (2020).

The final parts ask what happens when people are stuck in liminal spaces and how one should spend time there, with selections including Waiting for Godot (Scene 2), "Keeping Still", I'll Wait for the Next One..., "The Man Who Could Walk through Walls", and A Gentleman in Moscow (excerpt).

The section closes with ambient music as a liminal sound practice, using Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1979), Music for Nine Postcards (1982), and Sleep (2015), and asks whether ambient music is especially suited to liminal spaces.

## Learning guidelines

- As you explore this concept, discuss with your team: what are other examples of liminal spaces and thresholds in our own lives?
- Watch The Backrooms (2022), then discuss with your team whether it made you feel uneasy and whether you have felt similarly adrift.
- Consider POOLS and The Stanley Parable (2013): what aspects of liminal spaces make them effective game settings?
- Does Kant's thinking on beauty help us understand why people might be attracted to liminal spaces?
- Consider the listed station and transit works, then discuss with your team in what sense each depicts a liminal setting.
- Explore the architecture of waiting with your team: how can waiting-room design decrease anxiety or amplify it, and how should design vary by purpose?
- For the listed pieces, discuss with your team whether calling them liminal is fair or whether the term is being used too loosely.
- As you explore works about being stuck in-between, consider how we should approach spending time in liminal spaces and whether we should seek them out.
- After listening to ambient examples, discuss with your team whether ambient music should be used more for background listening, and whether it is especially music for liminal spaces.
