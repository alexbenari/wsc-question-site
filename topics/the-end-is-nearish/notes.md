## Topic text

- In November 2025, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh restored the practice of caretaker governments. In most countries with parliamentary systems, when an election is about to take place, a caretaker government runs things until the election is over. Learn more about caretaker governments—who staffs them, what are their main responsibilities, and what are they supposed to avoid doing?—and then discuss with your team: should caretaker governments be used in more countries and for longer periods of time? Have any caretaker governments refused to leave office when their time was up?
- The United States has no caretaker governments (neither does Venezuela), but it does limit its presidents to two four-year terms in office. As their second term begins to run out, they inevitably find themselves losing power and influence. They are said to become “lame ducks” as the country turns its attention to younger, healthier ducks who might win the next election. Discuss with your team: to prevent lame ducks, would it be better to have no limits on how long a person can lead a country or organization? What would you advise someone wanting to hold onto power for as long as possible?
- Queen Elizabeth I’s solution was to delay naming her successor. “I know the inconstancy of the people of England,” she is said to have told the Scottish ambassador, “How they ever mislike the present government and have their eyes fixed upon the person who is next to succeed.” Discuss with your team: would it be better if no one knew who the next leader would be until after the current leader left (or died)? Can you find an example of such a system?
- Someday there may be nobody left to lead. Consider the Doomsday Clock, which tries to measure how close we are to the end of human civilization. Discuss with your team: how accurate do you think it is, and in what ways, if any, is it a helpful tool?
- Midnight was coming. The world was on fire and people were dying of a terrible illness. Surely, the end of the world was near—or so thought Londoners in 1666. It was also near in 1844, 1910, 1988, 2000, and 2012. Doomsday predictions come and go more frequently in the social media age, but people have been predicting (and rescheduling) the end of the world for as long as they could hold up signs on street corners. With your team, explore the following instances of imminent doom, and consider: what do they have in common? What leads people to believe them—and what makes a doomsday prediction go viral?
- The Millerites (1844) | Wodziwob’s visions (1869) | Halley’s Comet Panic (1910)
- The Jupiter Effect (1974) | Hon-Ming Chen (1988) | The Y2K bug (2000)
- Large Hadron Collider (2008) | Mayan Apocalypse (2012)
- The four horsemen of the apocalypse, fires raging across more than California: the Book of Revelation has long offered artists a rich source of imagery for the end of the world. As you explore the following works from the European Renaissance, ask yourself: how does each artist distinguish between the destinations of the saved and the doomed—and is their tone one of terror or acceptance?
- Albrecht Dürer | The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1498)
- Sandro Botticelli | The Mystical Nativity (1500)
- Michelangelo | The Last Judgment (1536–1541)
- Pieter Bruegel the Elder | The Triumph of Death (c. 1562)
- Consider the more recent apocalypses depicted below. How have they changed as the world has moved toward industrial and digital anxiety—and what specific fears are these artists inviting us to explore?
- Thomas Cole | The Course of Empire: Destruction (1836)
- John Martin | The Great Day of His Wrath (1851–1853)
- Otto Dix | World War I prints (1924)
- Viktor Schreckengost | Apocalypse ‘42 (1942)
- Harry Louis Freund | Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1946)
- Saby Menyhei | The Last of Us: Season 1 Concept Art (2025)
- Kevin Sherwood & James McCawley | “Where Are We Going?” (2013)
- The end of the world can have a soundtrack, too. Consider the musical selections below. What were the circumstances around each one’s creation, and what techniques do they use to achieve their messages and moods?
- Olivier Messiaen | Quartet for the End of Time: “Abyss of the Birds” (1940)
- Black Sabbath | “Electric Funeral” (1970)
- REM | “It’s the End of the World as We Know It” (1987)
- Chaos, then catastrophe. Researchers have found that one of the signs that an ecosystem is about to collapse is that things become more volatile—for instance, the amount of chlorophyll in a lake rapidly spikes and plunges. Global climate change is causing something similar: extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts have grown more frequent. Even flights are facing more turbulence. Discuss with your team: what should we do if the climate passes a point of no return? Would it be okay to spend fewer resources on fighting climate change if the battle is already lost?
- Some investors are looking for business opportunities around the warming of the Earth. Explore some of those opportunities, then discuss with your team: should people be allowed to profit from rising temperatures? Could you imagine a company (or even a government) intentionally contributing to climate change, or other potential disasters, to benefit its own interests?

## Learning guidelines

- Learn more about caretaker governments, including staffing, responsibilities, and limits, then debate whether more countries should use them for longer and whether any overstayed their mandate.
- Discuss whether term limits should be removed to avoid lame-duck periods, and what strategies leaders use to retain power.
- Discuss whether succession should remain undisclosed until leadership transition, and identify systems that do this.
- Discuss how accurate and useful the Doomsday Clock is as a measure of existential risk.
- With your team, compare major doomsday scares and identify common patterns, drivers of belief, and viral spread dynamics.
- Compare Renaissance apocalypse artworks and evaluate how each depicts salvation versus damnation, and whether tone is terror or acceptance.
- Analyze modern apocalypse artworks for shifts toward industrial and digital anxieties and the specific fears they foreground.
- Analyze the selected music pieces by creation context, artistic technique, and mood/message construction.
- Discuss policy choices if climate change crosses a point of no return, including whether mitigation spending should change.
- Explore climate-failure business opportunities and debate whether profiting from warming is ethically acceptable.
