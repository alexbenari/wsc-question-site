## Topic text
"All roads lead to Rome," insisted one medieval European proverb. (In other parts of the world, roads led elsewhere.) While Roman roads may be the most famous for their longevity and scale, they were far from the first road network.

Explore the history of roads and the related terms below. Then, consider some of the most famous roads in the world both today and in ancient times.

Modern engineering is moving toward roads that do more than just sit on the ground: they participate actively in transport.

As you explore the innovations below, consider what problems they are trying to solve, what new ethical or environmental problems they might create, and whether the future of the road is paved at all.

Urban designers describe desire paths as unofficial trails that show how travelers choose routes in practice rather than in plans.

With your team, consider the logic of shortcuts and scenic routes, including how humans, animals, and even slime molds decide where to go.

Explore what makes stroads different from, and often more dangerous than, traditional streets and roads.

In the literary works below, the road is treated as a psychological landscape as much as a physical one.

The topic asks students to compare travel by choice and by necessity, and to examine why road trips became so associated with the United States.

It also asks whether long overland bus journeys count as road trips, why Route 66 remains culturally powerful, how motels shaped road travel, and whether art and music about roads idealize or critique car-based mobility.

The section closes by inviting reflection on circular versus straight-line travel through William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways.

- Read about the history of the road trip, then discuss why it is strongly associated with the United States.
- Investigate long overland journeys such as London-Calcutta and Transoceánica, and debate what counts as a road trip.

## Artworks
- Du Fu — Travelling Again (761 CE): A classical Chinese poem about movement and distance. Key context: Du Fu is a major Tang poet whose work often reflects displacement and social instability. In this topic, the poem frames travel as emotionally and politically charged rather than purely practical.
- William Shakespeare — Sonnet 50 (1609): A sonnet describing weary travel and emotional burden. Key facts: Sonnet 50 belongs to Shakespeare's 1609 sequence and links physical journeying to inward struggle. It supports the topic's contrast between chosen and constrained movement.
- John Masefield — Sea Fever (1902): A lyric poem expressing a powerful longing for the sea. Key context: Masefield's speaker is drawn to perpetual travel and open horizons. The poem highlights travel as desire and identity, not just transportation.
- Carl Sandburg — Window (1914): A short modern poem that treats a view outward as a prompt for imagination and movement. Sandburg's early 20th-century work often centers ordinary American life. Here it complements the theme of roads as psychological space.
- Robert Frost — The Road Not Taken (1915): A poem about choosing between diverging paths. Frost uses the road as metaphor for decision, memory, and self-narration. It directly reinforces the topic's focus on routes, choices, and consequences.
- W. B. Yeats — Sailing to Byzantium (1927): A poem of symbolic journey toward artistic and spiritual transformation. Yeats frames travel as movement between stages of life and value systems. It broadens the topic from literal roads to existential passage.
- Rüştü Onur — The Journey (early 20th century): A poem centered on travel's emotional and reflective dimensions. In context, the work emphasizes journey as process rather than destination. It supports discussion of why and how people move.
- Czesław Miłosz — This Only (1988): A late poem reflecting on time, transience, and lived experience. Miłosz's perspective connects movement through places with movement through memory and history. The piece supports the topic's reflective treatment of travel.
- Richard Russo — Just Drive (1992): A short story focused on driving as action and mental state. Key context: road movement becomes a frame for character and decision. It contributes to debate about whether driving liberates or isolates.
- Rita Dove — Vacation (1994): A poem engaging temporary escape and travel perspective. Dove often compresses social observation into concise imagery. Here the work helps examine expectations versus realities of leisure travel.
- Nat King Cole — (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66 (1946): A popular song celebrating U.S. highway travel by listing destinations along Route 66. The recording helped mythologize the road-trip experience in mass culture. It reflects how music can romanticize mobility.
- Edward Hopper — Western Motel (1957): An oil painting of a roadside motel scene with a solitary figure and car-oriented setting. Hopper's work often highlights isolation in modern environments. It offers a more ambiguous, less celebratory view of road culture.
- Ed Ruscha — Standard Station (1966): A painting/print image of a gas station rendered as a bold modern icon. Ruscha's Pop-inflected approach turns roadside infrastructure into visual symbol. The work links roads to consumer culture and modern design.
- Willie Nelson — On the Road Again (1980): A country song about constant touring and the pleasures of movement. It became a widely recognized anthem of life on the move. In this topic, it represents the optimistic narrative of road travel.
- David Hockney — Pearblossom Hwy., 11-18th April 1986, #2 (1986): A large photographic collage of a California highway assembled from multiple viewpoints. Hockney challenges single-point perspective and fixed visual direction. The piece complicates how roads are seen and experienced.
- Tom Cochrane — Life Is a Highway (1991): A rock song using the highway as a metaphor for life's momentum and obstacles. Its chorus helped embed road imagery in popular motivational language. It supports analysis of idealized road metaphors.
- Bic Runga — Drive (1996): A pop song that uses driving imagery to express emotional distance and connection. The work treats movement as intimate and psychological rather than geographic. It aligns with the topic's interior view of travel.
- Norah Jones — Come Away with Me (2002): A song inviting shared departure and quiet escape. Though not strictly about roads, its travel invitation fits mobility as emotional choice. It contributes a softer alternative to highway anthems.
- William Least Heat-Moon — Blue Highways (1982): A travel memoir about back-road journeys through the United States. Key facts: the title references blue secondary roads on old maps and emphasizes local encounters over speed. In this topic, it anchors reflection on purposeful wandering versus direct transit.

## Concepts
- Roman roads: An extensive engineered road network built across the Roman world. Key context: routes supported military movement, administration, and trade over long distances. Relevance: the topic uses Roman roads as a benchmark for durability and scale.
- Desire paths: Informal paths created by repeated foot traffic outside planned routes. Key context: they reveal collective route choices and practical optimization. Relevance: they frame discussion of efficiency versus design intent.
- Stroad: A hybrid corridor combining high-speed road functions with local street access. Key context: critics argue stroads are unsafe and economically inefficient because they do neither role well. Relevance: students are asked to evaluate local examples and tradeoffs.
- Bertha Benz long-distance drive (1888): A pioneering long-distance automobile trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim. Key context: Bertha Benz's journey demonstrated practical viability of early motor cars and prompted technical refinements. Relevance: it marks an origin point for modern road-trip culture.
