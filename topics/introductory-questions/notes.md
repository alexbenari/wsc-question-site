## Topic text

- The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but how does it end?
- Have you ever asked someone, “Are we there yet?” If so, whom were you asking—and where were you going? Did you ever get there?
- Have you ever gotten there, then decided it wasn’t worth it in the end?
- “ And now, the end is near ,” croons Frank Sinatra. But how do we know when we’re getting to an ending—or to a point of no return?
- In 2003, millions of people gathered at theaters to watch the final Lord of the Rings movie. They watched it for a long time : three and a half hours. Many complained they kept thinking the movie was about to end, only to have it keep going; by most counts, the movie had five separate endings . Today, if you were streaming it at home, you’d easily be able to check how much longer you had to go. Does it make a difference to your experience of a work to know how close you are to the end of it?
- How about in the real world? Does knowing something in your life—say, the school year, or a friendship—is about to end change how it feels or what it means to you?
- Has an ending ever taken you by surprise? If so, what kind of ending was it?
- When you’re working on a group project, how do you keep track of progress?
- “It’s not the destination, it’s the journey,” is a phrase often misattributed to the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. But is it ever just the destination?
- Sometimes, not getting there—or anywhere—can be beautiful too. Are there places that were neither where you started nor where you were going, but were worthwhile destinations in their own right?
- “ I just can’t wait to be king ,” complains Simba. He is not quite one thing, not quite another. Not everyone is the heir to the throne, but we do all spend time as teenagers, no longer children but not yet adults. Are there advantages to life in the in-between? Would it be better if we transitioned more quickly from childhood to adulthood?
- Are there lessons we can learn from technologies that once seemed about to arrive— nuclear-powered cars , food pills , 3D televisions, and many more—but haven’t yet?
- Do you keep a to-do list, or is it something you haven’t gotten around to? How much of your to-do list do you usually end up doing?
- The truth is that sometimes we’ll never get there at all. Most videogames are left unfinished ; nearly half of those who start university don’t get a degree. What do you think causes people to commit to things that they don’t complete—and are modern technologies making it easier or harder for us to get things done?
- The question of whether we’re there yet is asked in other fields, too, such as business and economics. Is a product ready to be launched? Have we reached the point of diminishing returns? Do these questions ever apply in everyday life as well?
- Here, the answers are probably yes and we’re getting there . So—let’s get started.

## Artworks

- My Way (1969)
  - Creator: Paul Anka (English adaptation); originally Jacques Revaux, Gilles Thibaut, and Claude Francois; popularized by Frank Sinatra
  - Sources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pcwq2usV7Y, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way
  - Description: A traditional pop song released as a Frank Sinatra single in 1969. It adapts the French song "Comme d'habitude" into a reflective first-person farewell voice. The work is associated with themes of endings, self-assessment, and personal agency, which directly fits this topic's questions about reaching an end point.
- The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)
  - Creator: Peter Jackson (director), from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel
  - Sources: https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2019/04/17/return-of-the-king-2003/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King
  - Description: A 2003 epic fantasy film with a long theatrical runtime and multiple closing sequences that resolve different character arcs after the main conflict. It won 11 Academy Awards and is often discussed for how it stages closure. In this topic, it illustrates that endings can be layered, emotionally different, and not reducible to a single final moment.
- I Just Can't Wait to Be King (1994)
  - Creator: Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics)
  - Sources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTwokjazG5Y, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Just_Can%27t_Wait_to_Be_King
  - Description: A song from Disney's 1994 film The Lion King, performed in-film by young Simba's singing voice. Its content expresses impatience to arrive at a future role and status. That makes it a direct cultural example for this topic's focus on "not yet" phases and the tension between present growth and desired destinations.

## Concepts

- Nuclear-powered cars (1950s-1960s concept era)
  - Sources: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/visions-of-nuclear-powered-cars-captivated-cold-war-america-but-the-technology-never-really-worked-180985437/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Nucleon
  - Description: A proposed automotive concept in which compact reactors would power vehicles for long ranges. Major engineering and safety limits, including shielding mass, reactor practicality, and waste handling, kept it at prototype or model stage. It is relevant as a case where anticipated technological arrival never fully happened.
- Food pills (meal-in-a-pill idea) (20th-century futurist trope to present)
  - Sources: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120221-food-pills-a-staple-of-sci-fi, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal_replacement
  - Description: A recurring futurist and science-fiction idea that complete meals could be condensed into pills. Real nutrition products exist as shakes and bars, but a true full-meal pill remains largely speculative in mainstream practice. For this topic, it represents a repeatedly promised destination that society has not fully reached.
- 3D television (consumer peak in early 2010s)
  - Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television
  - Description: Television systems that create depth perception through stereoscopic or related display methods, often requiring special glasses. Consumer rollout was significant for a short period, but many manufacturers discontinued mainstream support after weak sustained demand. It exemplifies an innovation that seemed imminent and then receded.
- Diminishing returns (year not applicable/unknown)
  - Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp
  - Description: An economic principle stating that adding more of one input, while holding others constant, eventually yields smaller incremental output gains. The concept helps decide whether continued effort is still efficient. In this topic, it connects progress questions in economics to everyday decision-making about effort and payoff.
