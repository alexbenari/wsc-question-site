  "topic_text": "- The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but how does it end?\n- Have you ever asked someone, \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d If so, whom were you asking\u2014and where were you going? Did you ever get there?\n- Have you ever gotten there, then decided it wasn\u2019t worth it in the end?\n- \u201c And now, the end is near ,\u201d croons Frank Sinatra. But how do we know when we\u2019re getting to an ending\u2014or to a point of no return?\n- In 2003, millions of people gathered at theaters to watch the final Lord of the Rings movie. They watched it for a long time : three and a half hours. Many complained they kept thinking the movie was about to end, only to have it keep going; by most counts, the movie had five separate endings . Today, if you were streaming it at home, you\u2019d easily be able to check how much longer you had to go. Does it make a difference to your experience of a work to know how close you are to the end of it?\n- How about in the real world? Does knowing something in your life\u2014say, the school year, or a friendship\u2014is about to end change how it feels or what it means to you?\n- Has an ending ever taken you by surprise? If so, what kind of ending was it?\n- When you\u2019re working on a group project, how do you keep track of progress?\n- \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey,\u201d is a phrase often misattributed to the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. But is it ever just the destination?\n- Sometimes, not getting there\u2014or anywhere\u2014can be beautiful too. Are there places that were neither where you started nor where you were going, but were worthwhile destinations in their own right?\n- \u201c I just can\u2019t wait to be king ,\u201d complains Simba. He is not quite one thing, not quite another. Not everyone is the heir to the throne, but we do all spend time as teenagers, no longer children but not yet adults. Are there advantages to life in the in-between? Would it be better if we transitioned more quickly from childhood to adulthood?\n- Are there lessons we can learn from technologies that once seemed about to arrive\u2014 nuclear-powered cars , food pills , 3D televisions, and many more\u2014but haven\u2019t yet?\n- Do you keep a to-do list, or is it something you haven\u2019t gotten around to? How much of your to-do list do you usually end up doing?\n- The truth is that sometimes we\u2019ll never get there at all. Most videogames are left unfinished ; nearly half of those who start university don\u2019t get a degree. What do you think causes people to commit to things that they don\u2019t complete\u2014and are modern technologies making it easier or harder for us to get things done?\n- The question of whether we\u2019re there yet is asked in other fields, too, such as business and economics. Is a product ready to be launched? Have we reached the point of diminishing returns? Do these questions ever apply in everyday life as well?\n- Here, the answers are probably yes and we\u2019re getting there . So\u2014let\u2019s get started.",

The work is associated with themes of endings, self-assessment, and personal agency, which directly fits this topic's questions about reaching an end point."

      "description": "A 2003 epic fantasy film with a long theatrical runtime and multiple closing sequences that resolve different character arcs after the main conflict. It won 11 Academy Awards and is often discussed for how it stages closure. In this topic, it illustrates that endings can be layered, emotionally different, and not reducible to a single final moment."
