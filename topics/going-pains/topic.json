  "topic_text": "- In 2001, millennial pop star Britney Spears sang that she was \u201cnot a girl, not yet a woman\u201d. In other words, she was an adolescent. Actually, she was 20 at the time\u2014no longer a teenager, but well below the age at which our frontal lobes stop developing . With your team, explore the history of teenagers and the related terms below. If adolescence has always been a developmental stage in both humans and many other animals , why is the idea of teenagers so new ?\n- prefrontal cortex | neural pruning | risk-taking | neophilia | differentiation\n- The word \u201cadolescent\u201d comes from a Latin word meaning \u201cto grow toward\u201d. But \u201cteenager\u201d relies on a quirk of the English language\u2014that the numbers 11 and 12 have their own unique words, while 13 through 19 are compound words that combine a single-digit number and a suffix meaning \u201cten\u201d (four-teen, six-teen, and so on). How do other languages refer to adolescents and teenagers\u2014and does your own first language differentiate between these two terms? What are their different connotations? Do cultures with languages that use a -ten suffix for the numbers 11 and 12 define the \u201cteenage\u201d years differently? For instance, in Spanish, the -ten suffix only comes into play at 16\u2014 diez (10) y seis (6); do children only become teenagers at 16 in Spanish-speaking countries?\n- Many cultures hold special ceremonies to celebrate the passage from the dependency of childhood to the responsibilities of adulthood. With your team, explore the following rites of passage and consider: what is the difference between a cultural rite, such as a quincea\u00f1era, and a secular one, like graduating from high school?\n- sweet sixteens | fiesta de quincea\u00f1era | vision quests\n- seijin no hi | bar and bat mitzvahs | walkabout | khatam al quran\n- debuts | high school graduation | driver\u2019s license | first paycheck\n- national service | voting | moving out\n- A ceremony offers a definite moment: now you are a man, or woman, or more broadly an adult. But the transition to adulthood is rarely a single, clean step; more often, it is a series of stumbles. The following works explore the messy middle years, where childhood collides with the expectations of tradition, society, and self-identity. As you explore them, consider: is adulthood a destination you reach or a mask you learn to wear?\n- Gwendolyn Brooks | \u201cWe Real Cool\u201d (1963)\n- Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve | \u201cThe Medicine Bag\u201d (1975)\n- Carol Ann Duffy | \u201cIn Mrs. Tilscher\u2019s Class\u201d (1990)\n- Joss Whedon | \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here?\u201d (2001)\n- Karen Russell | \u201cLucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves\u201d (2006)\n- Ruth B | \u201cLost Boy \u201d (2015)\n- Major Jackson | \u201cLet Me Begin Again\u201d (2021)\n- Millennials\u2014people born between about 1981 and 1995\u2014gave us side parts, skinny jeans, and \u201cadulting\u201d . This term transformed adulthood into a verb, something you do (often with great effort) rather than something you simply are . Whether going to bed early, scheduling a dentist appointment, or buying a vacuum cleaner, describing your actions as \u201cadulting\u201d implies you are just role-playing as a grown-up. Consider with your team: is being an adult a specific feeling or just a collection of habits and responsibilities? When do you think you will feel like an adult?\n- Life is a journey\u2014but does it end with a final port of call or a temporary layover? Explore the following works and discuss with your team: how do they handle the idea of life approaching its last liminal moment?\n- Rumi | \u201cA stone I died\u201d (c. 13th century)\n- John Donne | \u201cDeath Be not Proud\u201d (1633)\n- Alfred Lord Tennyson | \u201cUlysses\u201d (1842)\n- Emily Dickinson | \u201cBecause I could not stop for Death\u201d (1890)\n- Rabindranath Tagore | \u201cGitanjali 95\u201d (1913)\n- Dmitri Shostakovich | 15th Symphony: Fourth Movement (1972)\n- Thich Nhat Hanh | \u201cPlease Call Me by My True Names\u201d (1976)\n- David Berman | \u201cA Letter from Isaac Asimov to his Wife Janet, Written on His Deathbed\u201d (1999)\n- Linkin Park | \u201cIn the End\u201d (2000)",
