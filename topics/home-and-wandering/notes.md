## Topic Text
The topic examines navigation across oceans, ecosystems, cultures, and borders. It begins with early modern European seafaring and the compass, then turns to animal navigation mechanisms and examples such as indigo buntings, dung beetles, honeybees, pigeons, sea turtles, and desert ants. It compares digital navigation with traditional wayfinding systems, including Polynesian and Inuit methods, and asks what is lost when people outsource orientation to phones. It also explores knowledge-limiting map design through Fog of World.

The section then shifts to legal and political liminality: people stranded in airports, refugee exclusion, asylum policy, and immigration thresholds. It pairs policy questions with literary and artistic works on migration and displacement. Terms highlighted include astrolabe, sextant, log tables and ephemerides, magnetic compass, log and line, chronometer, latitude and longitude, magnetoreception, cryptochromes, olfactory navigation, echolocation, zugunruhe, constant frequency, frequency modulation, sunlight polarization, and spatial memory.

## Learning Guidelines
- Learn about key innovations that helped early European explorers navigate, then discuss how history might differ if they had stayed home.
- Learn about animal migration patterns and processes, then consider navigation vs instinct and human-caused disruption.
- Explore traditional non-instrument navigation methods and discuss how mental mapping changes journeys.
- Examine the Fog of World app and debate whether limiting easy information access can enrich experience.
- Watch highlights from The Terminal and compare the dramatized story with the real case of Mehran Karimi Nasser.
- Explore rationales for anti-immigrant policies and debate how open countries should be to asylum seekers.
- Analyze selected immigrant-experience poems for universality and liminality.
- Analyze selected artworks and songs about migration and in-between identity states.
