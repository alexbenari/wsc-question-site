## Topic text

People on the road have historically needed places to park themselves too. With your team, explore the history of inns and hotels, including what might be the oldest hotel in the world. What differentiates a hotel from earlier forms of accommodation, such as post houses.

The rise of hotels coincided with the rise of tourism, travel for leisure instead of for migration or business. Historians trace the roots of modern tourism to the grand tours of the 17th and 18th centuries, in which young aristocrats would travel across Europe as a rite of passage. Review a typical grand tourist itinerary, then discuss with your team: in what sense does this tradition continue today.

The grand tour was a privilege afforded mainly to the nobility and the wealthy. It took the emergence of the railway, the ocean liner, and the passenger jet, along with the rise of a middle class with enough disposable income, to bring tourism to the masses. Explore the history of leisure travel, then discuss with your team: why do certain places attract more tourists. Is it possible to attract too many.

Some people (and American politicians) long for the so-called Golden Age of Travel: an era of opulent ocean liners, spacious flying boats, and wealthy travelers dressed to impress. They contrast this glowing picture with the cramped seats on modern airplanes and images of barefooted passengers clipping their nails at 30,000 feet. Whether or not such a golden era ever existed, historians have their doubts. Discuss with your team: what, if anything, should be done to improve the travel experience today. Be sure to consider the psychology behind tourist misbehavior: is there something about traveling that encourages people to act in ways they would not at home.

Although nothing beats a Jet2 Holiday, tourists are increasingly avoiding tours that shuffle everyone through the same overcrowded museums and restaurants in favor of more authentic travel experiences. Explore the following niche forms of travel and consider what role social media may have had in promoting them. How realistic is it to engage in deep exchange and learning while on holiday.

voluntourism | edutourism | wellness retreats | dark tourism

People are not the only things that travel; goods do too. Before the era of long-distance shipping, a trader who did not want to confront the full length of a trade road might transport goods to or from an entrepot. These market towns were waystations where goods were imported, stored, and traded again without being subject to local duties. Learn more about the terms and places below as you explore the history of getting goods from here to there to an Amazon Prime truck.
