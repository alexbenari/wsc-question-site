  "body_html": "<ul style=\"margin: 0px;\">      \n        \t<li>In November 2025, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh restored the practice of caretaker governments. In most countries with parliamentary systems, when an election is about to take place, a <a href=\"https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/your-questions-on-notice/questions/do-the-prime-minister-and-ministers-keep-their-positions-during-an-election-period\" target=\"_blank\">caretaker government</a> runs things until the election is over. Learn more about caretaker governments—who staffs them, what are their main responsibilities, and what are they supposed to avoid doing?—and then discuss with your team: should caretaker governments be used in more countries and for longer periods of time? Have any caretaker governments refused to leave office when their time was up?</li>\n        \t\n        \t<li>The United States has no caretaker governments (neither does Venezuela), but it does limit its presidents to two four-year terms in office. As their second term begins to run out, they inevitably find themselves losing power and influence. They are said to become “lame ducks” as the country turns its attention to younger, healthier ducks who might win the next election. Discuss with your team: to prevent lame ducks, would it be better to have no limits on how long a person can lead a country or organization? What would you advise someone wanting to hold onto power for as long as possible?</li>\n        \t\n        \t<li>Queen Elizabeth I’s solution was to delay naming her successor. “I know the inconstancy of the people of England,” she is said to have told the Scottish ambassador, “How they ever mislike the present government and have their eyes fixed upon the person who is next to succeed.” Discuss with your team: would it be better if no one knew who the next leader would be until after the current leader left (or died)? Can you find an example of such a system?</li>\n        \t\n        \t<li>Someday there may be nobody left to lead. Consider the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-doomsday-clock-is-3-minutes-to-midnight-2016-1\" target=\"_blank\">Doomsday Clock</a>, which tries to measure how close we are to the end of human civilization.

      "excerpt": "Predictions of apocalyptic events that will result in the extinction of humanity, a collapse of civilization, or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the Common Era . [ 1 ] Most predictions are related to Abrahamic religions , often standing for or similar to the eschatological events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the Rapture , Great Tribulation , Last Judgment , and the Second Coming of Christ . End-time events are normally predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction and are usually made using the Bible—in particular the New Testament —as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions. [ 1 ] This often takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point in time where it will have been 6,000 years since the supposed creation of the Earth by the Abrahamic God , [ 2 ] which according to the Talmud marks the deadline for the Messiah to appear. [ 3 ] Predictions of the end from natural events have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands, or even billions, of years from now. Little research has been carried out into the reasons people have made apocalyptic predictions in modern times. [ 4 ] Historically, such predictions have been made for the purpose of diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, or promoting hatred of certain groups; [ 5 ] antisemitism was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times, while some French and Lutheran depictions of...",

PARIS — Amid collective failures to stop genocide and fascism in 2025, the Book of Revelation’s scenes of vivid combat between good and evil hit home. How satisfying to behold Saint Michael impaling a dragon in a Rhineland manuscript, for instance. At the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) in Paris, a show tracing the Apocalypse across the longer arc of art history is not just another exhibition about the Bible, but a far more biting critique. Apocalypse: Today and Tomorrow takes place in the exhibition hall of the François-Mitterrand site of the BnF, which holds one of the largest collections of Medieval European manuscripts in the world, having inherited the French crown's collection after the 1789 revolution. Playing to its strengths, the exhibition displays numerous Medieval manuscripts illustrating the Apocalypse alongside the work of artists who have reinterpreted these themes, including Albrecht Dürer's woodcuts, William Blake’s lush paintings, and lesser-known engagements by Odilon Redon and Wassily Kandinsky.",

When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come!' And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword. When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a balance in his hand; ... When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, 'Come!' And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him; and they were given great power over a fourth of the earth; to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.\" Transforming what was a relatively staid and unthreatening image in earlier illustrated Bibles, Dürer injects motion and danger into this climactic moment through his subtle manipulation of the woodcut. The parallel lines across the image establish a basic middle tone against which the artist silhouettes and overlaps the powerful forms of the four horses and riders—from left to right, Death, Famine, War, and Plague (or Pestilence).

      "excerpt": "The infant Christ reaches up towards the Virgin Mary, oblivious of his visitors – the Three Kings on the left and the shepherds on the right. The golden dome of heaven has opened up and is circled by 12 angels holding olive branches entwined with scrolls and hung with crowns. In the foreground, three pairs of angels and men embrace; among their feet demons scuttle for shelter in the underworld through cracks in the rocks. The Greek inscription mentions ‘the troubles of Italy’, a reference to the invasion of the French, who took Naples in 1494 and Milan in 1499, and to the civil strife in Florence itself. Botticelli associated these events with the turmoil mentioned in the biblical Book of Revelation, which talks about the end of the world and Christ’s second coming. The period of upheaval it described would end upon Christ’s return, when the devil would be buried, as in this picture. Christ’s birth is celebrated as the glorious revelation of God on Earth in this unique and colourful image by Botticelli . No fewer than 20 angels – all carrying leafy olive branches, a symbol of peace – preside over the revelry.",

The New York Historical New York, NY, United States While Thomas Cole built a successful career painting the scenery of the Hudson River Valley, he aspired to imbue landscape with a higher purpose. As early as 1827 he conceived a grand cycle of paintings that would illustrate the rise and fall of a civilization, and a few years later he began sketching and developing his ideas. The resulting series charts the course of an imaginative empire as it appears in the midst of wilderness, expands into a glistening metropolis, and collapses into ruin. Cole’s pessimistic allegory about doomed imperial ambition—likely intended as a warning about the fate of the United States —differed from prevailing beliefs among his contemporaries that the young Republic would never fail. Luman Reed, who commissioned The Course of Empire, did not live to see its completion. He died in June 1836, but Reed's family encouraged Cole to complete the work. The series was exhibited to great acclaim in New York later that year. The Course of Empire, along with the rest of Reed's collection, became the core of the New-York Gallery of the Fine Arts. That group of works was donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1858, forming the foundation of its acclaimed collection of American landscape painting.",

      "excerpt": "Donate Breadcrumb Home News & Insights ... Predicting environmental collapse Early warning signs help you prepare for, and hopefully prevent, the worst case scenario. What do stock market crashes, epileptic seizures, and ecological breakdowns have in common? They are all preceded by an increase in variance—be it fluctuations in the Dow Jones index, brain waves, or, in the case of a Wisconsin lake, chlorophyll. Cary Institute limnologist Jonathan Cole was part of a research team that was the first to reveal how variability in key ecosystem processes can help scientists identify the early warning signs of ecosystem collapse. Their paper was published in the journal Science .",

Here we argue that extreme day-to-day temperature changes, exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of historical records, are an independent, but largely ignored, aspect of extreme weather events. Such extreme temperature changes have a stronger impact on human health in many locations than do diurnal temperature variations. Global observations show that such events have become more frequent since the 1960s in low and mid-latitudes but decreased at high latitudes, primarily due to GHG forcing. Climate models project a further amplification of extreme day-to-day temperature changes under warming, with frequency, amplitude and total...",

The first leg of his flight from London to Singapore was fairly smooth. Then suddenly the plane hit severe turbulence. \"Being on a rollercoaster is the only way I can describe it,\" he recalls. \"After being pushed into my seat really hard, we suddenly dropped. My iPad hit me in the head, coffee went all over me. There was devastation in the cabin with people and debris everywhere.",

The world has reached its first climate tipping point as global warming causes widespread diebacks of warm-water coral reefs, scientists have warned . Rising temperatures are pushing several of Earth’s systems dangerously close to thresholds beyond which their demise accelerates and the global impacts become increasingly irreversible, according to a landmark report released on Monday.",
