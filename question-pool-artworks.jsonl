{"id":"q_D0000212","category":"context_clues","question":"Viewers defend The Sopranos ending because years invested feel too large to abandon; which bias, not present quality, is driving this defense?","choices":["Neural pruning","Sunk cost","Magnetoreception","Ambient drift","Hedonic adaptation"],"correct":"B","topics":["Concluding Questions"],"explanation":"\"Sunk cost\" is correct because prior investment, not present merit, drives the judgment. The topic’s ending debates use this trap to test how we evaluate closure."}
{"id":"q_D0000230","category":"context_clues","question":"Which song captures impatience to rule before maturity and responsibility?","choices":["My Way in Sinatra's signature version","The Return of the King film","In the End by Linkin Park","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","I Just Can't Wait to Be King"],"correct":"E","topics":["Introductory Questions"],"explanation":"\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" centers youthful eagerness for power without full readiness. The other options engage endings or retrospective voice instead of impatient pre-leadership desire. That contrast makes E the strongest match."}
{"id":"q_D0000312","category":"context_clues","question":"When judging The Sopranos ending, which response avoids sunk-cost reasoning?","choices":["Double current budget for this scenario","Reassess the finale on present merits","Ignore outcome forecasts for this scenario","Keep old assumptions unchanged for this scenario","Expand claims without evidence for this scenario"],"correct":"B","topics":["Concluding Questions"],"explanation":"Reassessing on present merits focuses on current evidence rather than past investment. The other responses preserve commitment inertia, which is classic sunk-cost logic."}

The other listed works foreground pause, threshold, ambiguity, or suspended arrival."}
{"id":"q_D0000374","category":"context_clues","question":"A crowded station image emphasizes social transition more than destination; which work best matches?","choices":["The Backrooms for this scenario","Train Station, Agra, 1983","POOLS for this scenario","The Man Who Could Walk through Walls","Sleep for this scenario"],"correct":"B","topics":["The Lovely and the Liminal"],"explanation":"Steve McCurry's Train Station, Agra, 1983 foregrounds crowd, pause, and social transit. That public-threshold quality best fits the scenario."}
{"id":"q_D0000395","category":"context_clues","question":"A poem uses roads as life choices, not engineering surfaces; which listed work best fits?","choices":["Route 66","On the Road Again","Come Away with Me","Blue Highways","Road Not Taken"],"correct":"E","topics":["Where We’re Going, We’ll Still Need Them"],"explanation":"Robert Frost's Road Not Taken uses roads metaphorically for decisions and self-narration. The other choices frame travel culture more literally through songs or memoir."}
{"id":"q_D0000458","category":"context_clues","question":"A museum exhibit pairs migration stories with a sonnet at the Statue of Liberty; which text is most likely featured?","choices":["The New Colossus","Sea Fever","The Road Not Taken","Window poem","Keeping Still"],"correct":"A","topics":["Home and Wandering"],"explanation":"The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus is the iconic Statue of Liberty immigration poem. The other works address movement or waiting differently but lack that symbolic linkage."}

It conveys compulsion toward motion rather than settled domesticity."}
{"id":"q_D0000600","category":"context_clues","question":"A 1888 long-distance drive proved automobile practicality and promoted roadside repair culture; whose trip was that?","choices":["Nat King Cole","William Least Heat-Moon","Robert Frost","Tom Cochrane","Bertha Benz"],"correct":"E","topics":["Where We’re Going, We’ll Still Need Them"],"explanation":"Bertha Benz's 1888 journey is the seminal demonstration drive cited in the topic. It showcased technical viability and practical support needs for early automobiles."}
{"id":"q_D0000705","category":"context_clues","question":"Which artwork best captures looping movement that never reaches a final destination?","choices":["The Backrooms","Ascending and Descending","Waiting for Godot (Scene 2)","POOLS for this scenario","The Stanley Parable"],"correct":"B","topics":["The Lovely and the Liminal"],"explanation":"Ascending and Descending visualizes perpetual circulation with no endpoint. The other works explore liminality, but Escher's loop is the most literal no-arrival structure."}
{"id":"q_D0000721","category":"context_clues","question":"Which introductory artwork adapts Tolkien's finale to cinema?","choices":["My Way used for this specific farewell performance scenario","I Just Can't Wait to Be King for this scenario","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King","Blade Runner film used for this specific cinematic closure scenario","The Terminal film used for this specific transit-limbo scenario"],"correct":"C","topics":["Introductory Questions"],"explanation":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is Peter Jackson's film adaptation of Tolkien's finale volume. The other options are songs or films from different contexts."}
