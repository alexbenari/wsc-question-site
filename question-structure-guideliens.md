You are creating World Scholar’s Cup–style multiple-choice questions designed to test knowledge, deep reasoning, synthesis, and contextual understanding.

  ## Question structure and content
* A question is one sentence long.
* Number of words <= 22
* Five answers, A-E
* Correct answer is randomly placed
* Avoid low-effort "catalog lookup" question forms that only ask whether an item belongs to a topic list (e.g., "Which listed concept belongs to this topic?").
* Each question should be from one of the content types listed below
  * Single topic understanding: 
    * evaluates memory and understanding of the main concepts, names and dates fron a single topic. Derived from any part of the topic material. Tests recall, comprehension, synthesis, and nuanced interpretation relatied to one or more key pieces of information related to the topic and explicitly referenced in the topic's material. Example: 
  * Context clues: 
    * Scenario-based questions that describe a situation or hint indirectly at the topic, requiring inference. Example: “If a government promised the moon but built only halfway there, which policy dilemma does it resemble?”
  * Comparative Consequences: 
    * Pertains to two topics. Asks how one phenomenon affects, mirrors, or contrasts with another, focusing on cause-and-effect reasoning. Example: “If Beethoven’s AI symphony mirrors Notre Dame’s restoration, both suggest what about human creativity?”
  * Thematic Synthesis: 
    * Pertains to two topics. Asks about the underlying shared idea, tension, or philosophical question uniting two or more works or topics. Example: “What unites ‘The Firebird’ and ‘The Fortune Teller’ across their different mediums?”
* 
  
  ## Answer structure and content
  * Answer length rule: The correct answer must never be longer than any of the distractors by more than one word. In other words, the correct answer must not stand out visually by being too long.
  * The correct answer does not have to be 100 percent correct, it only needs to be decisively more correct than the distractors. It should be the most defensible interpretation, not the only possible one
  * Question and choice phrasing must not “explain itself” — no wording in the question or options that hints at or reveals the correct reasoning.
  * Answer options must not include explanations or justifications (e.g., "because...", "since...", "therefore..."). Keep options concise; reasoning belongs in the `explanation` field.
  * Even incorrect answers should connect to genuine ideas in the curriculum.

  ## Explanation field
  * Every question must include an `explanation` field.
  * Explanation length: 2-5 sentences.
  * The explanation must include why the correct answer is the best answer.
  * The explanation may include why one or more distractors are incorrect, especially for deceptive distractors.
  * The explanation may include a small amount of extra context about the topic relevant to the question.
  * Explanations should be concise and factual; no fluff.
  * Explanations must be specific to the question content (name concrete concepts/people/artworks), not generic text like "it matches extracted material."
  
  ## Distractors' structure and content
  * Source fidelity: All distractors and topics must derive from the actual WSC extracted material
  * Avoid trivial distractors. No obviously absurd or universal/absolute statements (e.g., “Technology will become obsolete”). Avoid distractors which contain absolute/universal statements/truths. Such distractors are easy to rule out and thus make the questions easy. Distractors should be more open-ended and subtle. 
  * Plausibility: Every distractor should feel potentially true within the context of the topic.
  * Distinctiveness: Distractors for the same question should not overlap or be synonymous options of each other

## Question pool structure and content
* 20%-25% negatively phrased questions. E.g. "Which of the following is not..." 
* At least 20% of the questions should be about artworks, which includes literature, film, music, painting, architecture, etc., not just visual art.
* At least 20% of the questions should be about named people appearing in the topic material
